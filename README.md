# nvalt-prime

A smart nvAlt Preview Theme.

## Features

- Github theme
- Github markdown support
- simple checkbox support [] / [/]
- User Story detection (As a user, I expect ...)

## Installation

First, back up any custom files you've created previously. You can always restore the default just by deleting the `custom.css` and `template.html` files from `~/Library/Application Support/nvALT/`.

Copy the files in the zip folder to `~/Library/Application Support/nvALT/`. If the "nvALT" folder doesn't exist, create it or simply drag the folder you unzipped into **[User Home]→Library→Application Support**.

nvALT will automatically pick up this new theme even if it's already running. After switching notes you should see the change.
